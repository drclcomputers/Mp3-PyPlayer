Thank you for downloading Mp3 Pyplayer!
This is an open-source mp3, wav, ogg player made with python (includes tkinter, pygame, pillow modules).

Start by adding a file (you can delete it from the playback list).
Click on the file appeared in the list to load it into the player and then press the triangle to start.
You can pause, stop and play the next or the previous song.

The 'Other' tab has a limited volume adjuster.

In the 'Help' tab, you can change the skin of the player. Right Now, it comes with 4 skins.
